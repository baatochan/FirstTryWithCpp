# First Try with C++
C++ code written by me before the university (before Sep 2015).

Author: Bartosz Rodziewicz

This repo contains all the C++ code that I wrote before the university.
There is not much to see, but I have it as some kind of archive for me.

All the "apps" here are beginner's exercises and are very poorly written.

Everything is in Polish (sic!) :/
